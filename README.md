## Premier League Data Analysis
### Data Analysis of players

## 1. The dataset

The dataset has been found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/themlphdstudent/premier-league-player-stats-data "Dataset link").

> The data is scraped from the website https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/soccer/premier-league/player-stats by extracting the player stats in premier league.

I made two notebooks, in the first one I used plotly.express and matplotlib to visualize the data.
In the second one I used a module named DataPrep, I learned about this module and I wanted to implement it in this project.
